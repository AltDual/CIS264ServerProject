# CIS264ServerProject
For CIS264ProjectTeam67
idk how to comment on github 
run the main.py file in public folder
open second terminal and run the inference.py in model to refresh bus predictions 
will update automatically to the http server thing

everytime you want to refresh predictions must be done with "python inference.py" and then "Refresh Data" on page
