# CIS264ServerProject
For CIS264ProjectTeam67

To run the web app:  
First run the main.py file in server\public. It starts a local server on 127.0.0.1:8080

To refresh bus predictions:
Open a second terminal and run the inference.py in model
will update automatically to the HTTP server

Every time you want to refresh predictions must be done with "python inference.py" and then "Refresh Data" on page

We are still working to link different modules together.
